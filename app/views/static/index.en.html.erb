<h3>VCDelta provides simple tools for generating machine-readable VC investment data.</h3>
<p>Investors and entrepreneurs both want to share information about investment activity - it helps entrepreneurs find active investors, which benefits both parties.</p>
<p>That said, there's no standardized mechanism for sharing this information, and all sources of data are incomplete - which means tools for fundraising entrepreneurs are both difficult to build and often inaccurate. Databases like Crunchbase are often out of date. The Twitter bot <%= link_to "@VCDelta", "http://twitter.com/vcdelta/" %> scrapes venture capital websites and publicizes portfolio changes, but the tool is fragile and not all sites can be effectively scraped.</p>
<p>We have a proposal - a standardized 'investments.json' format for investors, easily readable by machines but easily createable by humans.  While the investments.json format has not been finalized, it's based on '<%= link_to "A Mechanism for VC Deal Transparency", "http://reactionwheel.blogspot.com/2013/04/a-mechanism-for-vc-deal-transparency.html" %>' by Jerry Neumann of <%= link_to "Neu Venture Capital", "http://neuvc.com/" %>. These machine-readable Javascript files would be hosted on investors' websites in a standardized location, easily discoverable by bots. Investors would be responsible for updating and hosting their own investments.json files.</p>
<p>Writing machine-readable Javascript can be trying at times, and a single out-of-place punctuation mark can render the whole file useless. Because of this, we're providing some web-based tools to make investments.json files a lot easier to create and maintain.</p>
